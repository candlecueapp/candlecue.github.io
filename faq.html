    <h1>FAQ</h1>

 

    
      <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>Q:</strong> What is CandleCue used for?</p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> CandleCue helps traders stay disciplined by tracking candle-close times on their selected
          timeframe—currently available for 1m, 2m, 3m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, or 4h. By setting precise alerts, it helps reduce
          impulsive trades and keeps you aligned with your strategy, one candle at a time.</p></div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Don’t most trading platforms already show countdowns to candle close?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Sort of—but you're still forced to watch the screen and track those countdowns manually.
        CandleCue enhances this by not only showing the countdown visually, but also providing audio and vibration cues at
        the moment each candle closes—so you can stay fully focused on your process, whether that's reading price action, confirming chart patterns or
        indicators, or analyzing footprint or Bookmap-style signals.<br><br>
    
        CandleCue also allows you to customize alert layers on top of your main timeframe. By default, you’ll receive a
        notification at the close of your selected timeframe. But you can also schedule early alerts — such as 5 minutes before — to help you anticipate candle closes with precision.<br><br>
    
        For example, if your main timeframe is 4 hours and you enable 1-hour, 2-hour, and 3-hour early alerts, CandleCue
        effectively gives you a 1-hour sub-timeframe layer to track market rhythm without having to switch charts. The
        result: microstructure insight, better preparation, and fewer surprises at critical candle transitions.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>Q:</strong> I'm a swing trader and trade off the 4-hour timeframe. Can I customize when each 4-hour candle
          starts?</p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. By default, CandleCue uses a 4-hour cycle starting from UTC 0—a common baseline for crypto
          traders. However, you can choose a custom start time in Settings, such as 9:00 AM or 9:30 AM (local time), in
          30-minute increments to better align with your preferred trading hours or market session.</p></div>
  
      <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I use CandleCue in the background?</p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. Once activated, the timer continues running even when the app is in the background or when
          your phone goes to sleep. In fact, this is one of CandleCue’s core features—helping you stay in sync with market
          rhythms even when you’re away from the screen. Occasionally, CandleCue may prompt you to return to the main page to
          continue receiving notifications, but the timer itself runs continuously in the background at all times.</p></div>



      <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>Q:</strong> When will I be prompted to return to the main page to continue receiving notifications?</p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Apple enforces a system-wide limit of 64 scheduled notifications per app. Depending on your
          selected timeframe and any layered alerts, you may reach this limit after a certain number of candles. For example,
          if you're using a 4-hour main timeframe with 1-hour layered alerts to also track the 1-hour chart, you’ll be
          prompted approximately 60 hours after the timer starts. When that happens, CandleCue will play a distinct sound
          alert and prompt you to return to the main page—so it can refresh and schedule the next set of alerts for the
          following 60 hours. The timer itself continues running in the background without interruption.</p></div>


          <div class="faq-item">
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> Does CandleCue require an internet connection?</p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> No. CandleCue runs entirely offline and uses your device’s internal system time to track
              candles.
              An internet connection is only needed to download the app, receive updates, or access support links like Privacy
              Policy and Terms of Service.</p></div>



          <div class="faq-item">
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> Does CandleCue track my data?</p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> No. CandleCue does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Your use is completely
              private.</p>
            </div>
            

            <div class="faq-item">
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> Will CandleCue ever introduce ads in the future?</p>
              <p><strong>A:</strong> No. CandleCue prioritizes distraction-free trade execution, and will never include ads—whether
                the timer is running or not. Our goal is to help you stay focused, not interrupted.</p>      </div>
