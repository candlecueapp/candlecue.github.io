    <h3>What is CandleCue used for?</h3>
    <p>
      CandleCue helps traders stay disciplined by providing structured alerts to candle-close times on their selected timeframe—currently
      supporting 1m, 2m, 3m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, and 4h.  Pre-close signals and layered cues from shorter
      sub-timeframes provide
      added awareness within each candle. By setting precise, structured alerts, CandleCue is designed to reduce impulsive
      trades and help you stay aligned with your strategy—candle by candle.
    </p>
    </div>
  
 

  <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #333; padding-bottom: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3>Don’t most trading platforms already show countdowns to candle close?</h3>
    <p>
      Most platforms show candle countdowns—but they’re easy to miss, often displayed in small fonts that demand constant
      visual attention. Even more limiting, these countdowns are tied to the chart you’re actively
      viewing—meaning you have to keep that specific symbol open to stay on time.
      CandleCue enhances your charting experience by delivering clear, hands-free alerts through audio and haptic
      feedback—so you stay in sync without staring at the countdown or keeping one chart always in view.
      Optional pre-close signals and layered sub-timeframe cues further ease the cognitive load of manual tracking while
      enhancing market awareness and timing.
      <em>Ideal for active traders who want to focus on preparation and execution—not countdowns—and swing traders who
        want to stay alert only when it counts.</em>
    </p>
    </div>
  
 
  
  <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #333; padding-bottom: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3>What are custom alerts, and why do they matter?</h3>
    <p>
      Ever missed an entry or exit because your attention was on something else—an indicator, setup, or analysis—and the
      candle closed before you were ready?
      Custom pre-close alerts give you a head start—reminding you to refocus and prepare before the candle ends, so you’re
      ready to act when it counts.
      For example, you can set recurring reminders like “2 minutes before” to review your checklist, confirm confluence,
      or get into execution mode.
      You can even set multiple early alerts (e.g., 5 minutes and 1 minute before) to match your personal routine. These
      cues repeat every candle, helping you stay sharp, consistent, and timely.
    </p>
    </div>

 
  
  <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #333; padding-bottom: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3>What are layered alerts, and how do they differ from custom alerts?</h3>
    <p> Market structure often shifts before your main timeframe candle closes—making it easy to miss developing setups or
    misread early signals. Layered alerts solve this by triggering at actual sub-timeframe bar closes—like every 5 or 15
    minutes within a 1-hour candle.
    
    Instead of constantly flipping between different timeframes and reacting to unfinished candles, you get precise, confirmation-based
    signals across multiple timeframes. For example, if your main candle is 1 hour, layering 15-minute bars gives you
    actionable structure every quarter hour.
    
    Unlike custom alerts—which notify you before a main candle closes—layered alerts provide smaller, completed timeframe
    cues. Together, they give you a structured, multi-layered view of market behavior—delivered with precision and without
    distraction.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #333; padding-bottom: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3>Can I layer more than one sub-timeframe?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely. For example, you can layer 5-minute, 15-minute, and 30-minute sub-timeframes into your 60-minute
      (1-hour) main interval. This allows you to receive multiple bar-close notifications within each hour—offering a more
      detailed view of market structure across different time horizons.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #333; padding-bottom: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3>If I layer multiple sub-timeframes, what happens when several timeframes close at the same time?</h3>
    <p>When multiple sub-timeframe bars close simultaneously, CandleCue will send only the notification for the largest (i.e.,
      highest) timeframe at that moment. For example, if your main timeframe is 1 hour and you’ve layered both 15-minute
      and 30-minute intervals, you’ll receive the 30-minute alert at the half-hour marks (e.g., 9:30, 10:30), rather than
      the 15-minute one.<br><br>This helps avoid redundant signals and keeps the focus on higher timeframe closes, which
      often carry more weight in trade planning. It also reflects how many traders prioritize higher timeframes for trend
      context, while using lower ones for execution.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #333; padding-bottom: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3>I'm a swing trader using the 4-hour timeframe. Can I customize when each 4-hour candle starts?</h3>
    <p>Yes. By default, CandleCue uses a 4-hour cycle starting from UTC 0—a common baseline for crypto traders. You can
      set a custom start time in Settings (e.g., 9:00 AM or 9:30 AM local time) in 30-minute increments to match your
      preferred trading hours or market session.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #333; padding-bottom: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3>Can I use CandleCue in the background?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Once activated, both the timer and alerts continue to function even when the app is in the background or your
      phone is asleep. In fact, this is one of CandleCue’s core features—helping you stay synced to market rhythms even
      when away from your screen. Occasionally, CandleCue may prompt you to the main page to continue receiving
      notifications, but the timer itself runs continouosly in the background at all times.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #333; padding-bottom: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3>When will I be prompted to return to the main page?</h3>
    <p>Apple enforces a maximum of 64 scheduled notifications limit per app at any one time. Depending on your selected
      timeframe and any alerts, you may reach this limit after a certain number of candles. For example, if you're
      using a 4-hour main timeframe with 1-hour layered alerts, you'll be prompted approximately 60 hours after the timer
      starts. When this happens, CandleCue will play a distinct sound and prompt you to return to the main page. By simply
      tapping on the prompt or reopening the app, the next batch of notifications and alerts will be scheduled instantly, and you will continouosly receive them. The timer itself continues running in the background the entire time, and no data or alert
      preferences are lost.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #333; padding-bottom: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3>How is the “Current Time” determined, and how can I change it?</h3>
    <p>
      CandleCue automatically detects your device’s local time and displays the “Current Time” using the correct UTC
      offset for your region.
      If you prefer to track time based on another region—such as a major financial center—you can change this in Settings
      under “Select UTC Offset.”
    </p>
    <p>
      UTC offset options range from UTC−10 to UTC+13, including fractional time zones like UTC+5:30 and UTC+9:30. This
      lets you align your alerts with the market hours you care about most.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>UTC−10:</strong> Honolulu (Hawaiian Islands)</li>
      <li><strong>UTC−8:</strong> Los Angeles (non-DST), Vancouver (non-DST)</li>
      <li><strong>UTC−6:</strong> Mexico City</li>
      <li><strong>UTC−5:</strong> New York (non-DST), Toronto (non-DST), Cancún, Lima, Bogotá</li>
      <li><strong>UTC+0:</strong> London (non-DST), Accra, Lisbon</li>
      <li><strong>UTC+1:</strong> Berlin, Paris, Rome, Madrid</li>
      <li><strong>UTC+2:</strong> Athens, Cairo, Johannesburg</li>
      <li><strong>UTC+3:</strong> Moscow, Riyadh, Istanbul, Nairobi</li>
      <li><strong>UTC+4:</strong> Dubai, Baku</li>
      <li><strong>UTC+5:30:</strong> Delhi, Mumbai, Colombo</li>
      <li><strong>UTC+8:</strong> Singapore, Beijing, Kuala Lumpur, Perth</li>
      <li><strong>UTC+9:</strong> Tokyo, Seoul</li>
      <li><strong>UTC+9:30:</strong> Adelaide, Darwin</li>
      <li><strong>UTC+10:</strong> Sydney, Port Moresby</li>
      <li><strong>UTC+13:</strong> Nukuʻalofa (Tonga), Kiritimati (Kiribati)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This flexibility allows you to stay in sync with the trading hours of any global market—whether it’s your local
      exchange or one halfway across the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The “Select UTC Offset” setting only affects how the current time is displayed. It does not
      change how alerts or timer intervals are calculated. Your candles and alerts will continue to follow the same logical
      timing, regardless of the selected display offset.</p>

  <summary>How is the “Current Time” determined, and how can I change it?</summary>
  <p>
    When you first install CandleCue, the app automatically detects your device’s local time zone and sets the UTC

  </p>
  <p>
    You can change this offset at any time in Settings under “Select UTC Offset” to view the current time in another
    region—such as a major financial center or preferred market.
  </p>
  <p>
    UTC offset options range from UTC−10 to UTC+13, including fractional time zones like UTC+5:30 or UTC+9:30. This
    lets you align your time display with the regions or markets that matter to you.

  <summary>Does CandleCue require an internet connection?</summary>
  <p>No. CandleCue runs entirely offline using your device’s internal system clock. You only need internet access to
    download the app, receive updates, or access support links like the Privacy Policy or Terms of Service.</p>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Does CandleCue track my data?</summary>
  <p>No. CandleCue does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. Your use of the app is
    completely private. The only data saved is your selected preferences—such as alert settings, UTC offset, or language
    choice—and even that is
    stored locally on your device. Nothing ever leaves your phone, ensuring a streamlined and secure experience.</p>
