    <h1>FAQ</h1>

    <!-- <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What is CandleCue used for?</summary>
      <p>CandleCue helps traders stay disciplined by providing structured alerts to candle-close times on their selected
        timeframe—currently supporting 1m, 2m, 3m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, and 4h. Pre-close signals and layered cues from
        shorter
        sub-timeframes provide added awareness within each candle. By setting precise, structured alerts, CandleCue is
        designed to reduce impulsive trades and help you stay aligned with your strategy—one candle at a time.</p>
    </details> -->

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What does CandleCue do, and how can it help improve my trading?</summary>
      <p>
        <!-- CandleCue helps you trade with clarity and control by delivering structured alerts anchored to your selected
        timeframe. -->
        Whether you're trading 1-minute scalps or 4-hour swings, CandleCue keeps you aligned with your strategy and help form correct trading habits.
        <!-- —so you don't have to constantly watch the clock.
      </p>
      <!-- <p>
        Pre-close signals let you prepare before a candle closes. Layered alerts from shorter sub-timeframes offer insight
        into what's unfolding inside your main candle—helping you stay in rhythm with real-time market shifts.
      </p> -->
      <p>
        Ultimately, CandleCue is designed to reduce impulsive trades and support consistent execution—keeping you focused,
        disciplined, and fully in control of your decisions.
      </p>
      </details>
<!-- 
    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Don’t most trading platforms already show countdowns to candle close?</summary>
      <p>Some do—but countdowns on most platforms are small, easy to miss, and tied to a single chart. To keep pace, you
        must constantly watch the screen and keep one symbol open at all times, which can lead to distraction or even
        premature trades based on incomplete candles.</p>
    
      <p>This constant monitoring splits your focus and increases the risk of overtrading or revenge-trading—reacting
        impulsively to every tiny move while losing sight of your intended timeframe. Even if you’re disciplined, tracking
        both chart movement and a tiny off-center timer adds unnecessary cognitive strain.</p>
    
      <p>By delivering structured, hands-free alerts through audio and haptics, CandleCue supports disciplined trading—so
        your attention stay soley anchored to execution. With custom pre-close alerts and layered
        sub-timeframe
        cues, it helps reinforce healthy trading habits and timing discipline. Ideal for both active traders who want to
        stay
        sharp and swing traders who only want to tune in when it truly counts.</p>
      </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What are custom alerts, and why do they matter?</summary>
      <p>Ever missed an entry or exit because the candle closed before you were ready? CandleCue’s custom pre-close
        alerts give you a head start by reminding you to refocus and prepare before the candle ends—so you’re ready to
        act when it counts.</p>
      <p>Whether you’re waiting for one last confirmation or second-guessing your setup, these cues bring your focus
        back at
        just the right moment. For example, you can set recurring reminders like “2 minutes before” to finalize your
        checklist, confirm confluence, or get into execution mode. You can even set multiple early alerts (e.g., 5
        minutes
        and 1 minute before) to match your personality or trading routine.</p>
      <p>These alerts repeat every candle, helping you stay sharp, consistent, and ready when it matters.</p>
    </details>

 

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>What are layered alerts, and how do they differ from custom alerts?</summary>
  <p>Market structure often shifts well before a main candle closes—meaning two candles on the same timeframe can look
    identical at the end but tell very different stories underneath. Layered alerts help reveal that story early by
    triggering at the close of sub-timeframe bars—like every 5 minutes within a 1-hour candle—so you can stay in
    rhythm with evolving market conditions.</p>

  <p>This gives you confirmation-based timing cues without needing to constantly flip through different timeframes or
    guess based on an unfinished candle. For example, if your main candle is 1 hour and you set 15-minute sub-timeframe
    layering, you'll get alerts every quarter
    hour when each 15-minute bar closes. This can help you recognize momentum shifts, indecision, or strength as it
    unfolds—<em>before</em> your main candle finishes printing.</p>

  <p>Unlike custom alerts—which notify you shortly before your main candle closes—layered alerts provide completed
    signals from within the candle itself. Used together, they offer a structured, multi-timeframe view of market
    behavior. Layered alerts show what’s developing underneath, while custom alerts help you prepare to act when your
    main candle is about to close—clear, precise, and distraction-free.</p>
</details>


    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Can I layer more than one sub-timeframe?</summary>
      <p>Absolutely. For example, you can layer 5-minute, 15-minute, and 30-minute sub-timeframes into your 60-minute
        (1-hour) main interval. This allows you to receive multiple bar-close notifications within each hour—offering a
        more
        detailed view of market structure across different time horizons.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>If I layer multiple sub-timeframes, what happens when several timeframes close at the same time?
      </summary>
      <p>When multiple sub-timeframe bars close simultaneously, CandleCue will send only the notification for the
        largest
        (i.e., highest) timeframe at that moment. For example, if your main timeframe is 1 hour and you’ve layered both
        15-minute
        and 30-minute intervals, you’ll receive the 30-minute alert at the half-hour marks (e.g., 9:30, 10:30), rather
        than
        the 15-minute one.</p>
      <p>This helps avoid redundant signals and keeps the focus on higher timeframe closes, which often carry more
        weight in
        trade planning. It also reflects how many traders prioritize higher timeframes for trend context, while using
        lower
        ones for execution.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>I use order flow charts to trade. How can CandleCue help me trade better?</summary>
      <p>Even when using real-time order flow tools like Bookmap, CandleCue's time-based alerts can still add valuable
        structure and context in the following ways:</p>
    
      <p>• Order flow is continuous — but market structure is discrete. Candles give you a framework to mentally group
        activity into meaningful phases.</p>
    
      <p>• You'll stay aware of your position within the session — such as the end of a 15-minute bar or the midpoint of a
        1-hour bar — which often align with liquidity shifts, trap setups, or breakout failures.</p>
    
      <p>• This awareness helps filter noise and confirm intent. For instance, absorption at the close of a 15-minute bar
        can carry more weight than absorption mid-bar.</p>
    
      <p>• Many trading algorithms are programmed to trigger, pause, or adapt behavior at specific times — like market
        open/close or the top and bottom of the hour.</p>
    
      <p>Ultimately, it's easy to get lost in the heatmap. CandleCue helps you sync visual flow with time-based structure —
        a layer of edge many traders overlook.</p>
      </details>



    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>I’m a swing trader using the 4-hour timeframe. Can I customize when each 4-hour candle starts?</summary>
      <p>Certainly! By default, CandleCue uses a 4-hour cycle starting from UTC+0—a common baseline for crypto traders.
        To change this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong></li>
        <li>Under <strong>Select 4-Hour Block</strong>, choose <strong>Custom</strong></li>
        <li>Then select your desired <strong>Custom Start Time</strong> (e.g., 9:00 AM or 9:30 AM) in 30-minute
          increments
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This allows you to align your candle timing with your local trading hours or a preferred market session.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Does CandleCue still work when my phone is asleep or I’m away from the app?</summary>
      <p>Yes. Once activated, both the timer and alerts continue to function even when the app is running in the
        background—including when your phone is asleep. In fact, alerts will still come through on schedule—even if
        you’ve
        accidentally swiped CandleCue away from your recent apps list (i.e., force-quit). Tapping an alert or reopening
        the app will take you right where you left off.</p>
      <p>This background support is one of CandleCue’s key features—helping traders stay in tune with market rhythm,
        whether
        actively monitoring charts, stepping away briefly, or trading longer timeframes—without needing to worry about
        whether the app is open or the phone is asleep.</p>
      <p>If the app has been in the background for an extended period of time, CandleCue may send a friendly reminder to
        reopen the app to continue receiving notifications, but the timer itself runs continuously in the background at
        all
        times.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Why are some notifications delayed by up to 10 seconds?</summary>
      <p>
        In rare cases — especially if your phone is locked or put to sleep within 30 seconds of your next alert, or when
        checking
        notifications from the lock screen — some alerts may be delayed by a few seconds, sometimes up to 10 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        This behavior appears more frequently on newer devices running iOS 18. It's not caused by the app itself, but by how
        iOS
        handles notification delivery under certain conditions.
      </p>
      <p>🧠 <strong>Tip:</strong> Some users have reported more consistent, on-time notifications after adjusting system
        settings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to <strong>Settings › Apple Intelligence & Siri</strong></li>
        <li>Temporarily disable Apple Intelligence and monitor whether the delay disappears</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We continue to test and optimize alert behavior across different iPhone models and iOS versions. If you’re
        experiencing this, please know you're not alone — and this does not affect the accuracy of your scheduled timer
        logic.
      </p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Why are some notifications delayed by up to 10 seconds?</summary>
        <p>
          In rare situations — such as when your phone is locked shortly before an alert is scheduled to fire, or when
          checking
          notifications from the lock screen — iOS may delay certain alerts by a few seconds, sometimes up to 10 seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not caused by the app itself. It reflects how iOS manages background processes and notification delivery
          under newer power management and privacy conditions, especially on devices running iOS 18.
        </p>
        <p>🧠 <strong>Tip:</strong> Some users have found that alerts arrive more precisely after adjusting the following
          system setting:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Go to <strong>Settings › Apple Intelligence & Siri</strong></li>
          <li>Temporarily disable Apple Intelligence and observe whether the delay disappears</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We’ve thoroughly tested this app across multiple iOS versions and devices. If you're noticing this behavior, you're
          not alone —
          and it doesn’t affect the timer’s internal accuracy or logic.
        </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Why are some notifications delayed by up to 10 seconds?</summary>
          <p>
            In rare cases, especially on newer iPhones running iOS 17.5 or later, a small delay in notification delivery may
            occur
            — typically up to 10 seconds — when:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your phone locks within 30 seconds of a scheduled alert</li>
            <li>You check notifications from the lock screen using Face ID or gestures</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This behavior isn’t caused by the app itself. It results from how iOS defers background tasks to preserve battery
            and
            prioritize various system-level features.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>✅ What you can do:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Test notifications using the 1-minute time frame along with a few custom alerts</li> 
            <li>Then press the power button to lock your phone within 30 seconds of an upcoming alert</li>
            <li>Let the screen stay off until the expected alert time</li>
            <li>Observe whether the notification arrives exactly at the expected time or with a delay</li>
            <li>If you notice delays, try this:
              <ul>
                <li>Open <strong>Settings › Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri</strong></li>
                <li>Temporarily turn off Apple Intelligence and retest alerts</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We continue to monitor and test notification behavior across devices. If you're affected, please know you're not
            alone
            — and your timers are still scheduled correctly. The delay is only in iOS’s final delivery timing.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Why are some notifications delayed by up to 10 seconds?</summary>
          <p>
            On newer iPhones running iOS 17.5 or later, you may occasionally notice a delay — typically up to 10 seconds — in
            scheduled alert delivery when:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your phone is locked within 30 seconds of an upcoming alert</li>
            <li>You check notifications from the lock screen using Face ID or gestures</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This behavior isn’t caused by the app itself. It results from how iOS manages background activity to conserve
            battery and prioritize system-level processes.
          </p>
          <p><strong>✅ How to test and troubleshoot:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Set the timer to the 1-minute interval and enable a few custom alerts</li>
            <li>With about 30 seconds left, press the power button to lock your phone</li>
            <li>Leave the screen off until the alert should fire</li>
            <li>Observe whether it arrives on time or is delayed</li>
            <li>If you notice delays, try this:
              <ul>
                <li>Open <strong>Settings › Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri</strong></li>
                <li>Temporarily disable Apple Intelligence and repeat the test</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We're continuing to test alert performance across iOS versions and devices. If you experience a delay, know that
            your timers are still scheduled accurately — only the system’s final delivery timing is affected.

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Why are some notifications delayed by up to 10 seconds?</summary>
            <p>
              On some newer iPhones (iOS 17.5+), alerts may occasionally arrive up to 10 seconds late — especially if the phone is
              locked shortly before the scheduled time or you check notifications in the lock-screen via Face ID.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not a bug in the app. It’s how iOS sometimes delays background tasks to optimize battery and system
              performance.

      <summary>Why does CandleCue sometimes ask me to reopen the app?</summary>
      <p>iOS allows only 64 scheduled notifications per app. If CandleCue goes into the background and stays there for
        an
        extended period, those scheduled alerts may eventually run out—depending on your selected timeframe and alert
        settings. For example, this might happen after ~60 hours with a 4-hour main timeframe and 1-hour layered alerts.
      </p>
      <p>When that happens, CandleCue sends a gentle reminder to reopen the app. Just tap the prompt (or open the app
        manually) to reload alerts instantly. Your timer keeps running the entire time, and none of your settings are
        lost.</p>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>How is the “Current Time” determined, and how can I change it?</summary>
      <p>When you first install CandleCue, the app automatically detects your device’s local time zone and assigns a corresponding UTC offset. This offset is used  to display the “Current Time” at the bottom of the screen.</p>
      <p>You can change this offset at any time in <strong>Settings</strong> under <em>Select UTC Offset</em> to view the current time in
        another
        region—such as a major financial center or preferred market.</p>
        <p>Available UTC offset options range from UTC−10 to UTC+13, including fractional UTC offsets like UTC+5:30 or UTC+9:30.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>UTC−10:</strong> Honolulu (Hawaiian Islands)</li>
        <li><strong>UTC−8:</strong> Los Angeles (non-DST), Vancouver (non-DST)</li>
        <li><strong>UTC−6:</strong> Chicago (non-DST), Guatemala City, Mexico City</li>
        <li><strong>UTC−5:</strong> New York (non-DST), Toronto (non-DST), Cancún, Lima, Bogotá</li>
        <li><strong>UTC−3:</strong> São Paulo, Buenos Aires</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+0:</strong> London (non-DST), Accra, Lisbon (non-DST)</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+1:</strong> Berlin, Paris, Rome, Madrid</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+2:</strong> Athens, Cairo, Johannesburg</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+3:</strong> Moscow, Riyadh, Istanbul, Nairobi</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+4:</strong> Dubai, Baku</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+5:30:</strong> Delhi, Mumbai, Colombo</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+7:</strong> Hanoi, Bangkok, Jakarta</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+8:</strong> Perth, Singapore, Beijing, Kuala Lumpur</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+9:</strong> Tokyo, Seoul</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+9:30:</strong> Adelaide (non-DST), Darwin</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+10:</strong> Brisbane, Sydney (non-DST), Port Moresby</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+13:</strong> Nukuʻalofa (Tonga), Kiritimati (Kiribati)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The UTC offset remains fixed until you change it manually. It does not adjust
        automatically
        for daylight saving time. This setting only affects how the current time is <em>displayed</em>—it does not change how
        alerts
        or timer intervals are calculated.</p>

        <summary>Will I receive alerts if my phone is in Do Not Disturb (DND) under Focus Mode?</summary>
        <p>
          If your device is running <strong>iOS 15 or later</strong>, CandleCue’s main candle-close alerts are designed to be
          delivered while  Focus Mode is active such as Do Not Disturb. These are marked as <strong>Time Sensitive</strong> to
          ensure you never miss a critical candle close.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, <strong>sub-timeframe alerts</strong> and <strong>pre-close warnings</strong> are not marked as Time
          Sensitive. These will be silenced while Focus Mode is on.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Tip 1:</strong> To ensure candle-close alerts always reach you, go to:<br>
          <em>Settings → Notifications → CandleCue → Time Sensitive Notifications</em> and make sure it's enabled.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Tip 2:</strong> To ensure <em> all </em> alerts reach you at all times, go to:<br>
          <em>Settings → Focus → Do Not Disturb    </em> and make sure to add CandleCue under "Allow Notifications".
        </p>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Does CandleCue require an internet connection?</summary>
      <p>No. CandleCue runs entirely offline using your device’s internal system clock. You only need internet access to
        download the app, receive updates, or access support links like the Privacy Policy or Terms of Service.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Does CandleCue track my data?</summary>
      <p>No. CandleCue does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. Your use of the app
        is
        completely private. The only data saved is your selected preferences—such as alert settings, UTC offset, or
        language
        choice—and even that is stored locally on your device. Nothing ever leaves your phone, ensuring a streamlined
        and
        secure experience.</p>
