    <h1>FAQ</h1>

<!--   

  <div class="faq-item">
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What is CandleCue used for?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> CandleCue helps traders stay disciplined by tracking candle-close times on their selected
      timeframe—currently available for 1m, 2m, 3m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, or 4h. By setting precise alerts, it is desigend to reduce
      impulsive trades and keeps your aligned with your strategy—candle by candle.</p>
  </div>
   
  
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Don’t most trading platforms already show countdowns to candle close?</p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> They do—but they still require you to actively watch the screen and mentally track the timer.
    CandleCue frees you from that constant attention by delivering precise, hands-free alerts at every candle close using
    audio and haptic feedback. With additional support for custom alerts and layered sub-timeframe notifications, you can
    stay in sync with market timing—ideal for price action readers, pattern watchers, and anyone managing multiple
    screens.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> What are custom alerts, and why do they matter?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Custom alerts let you prepare ahead of each bar close. Have you ever missed an entry or exit
        because, the moment the candle closed, volatility spiked and you weren’t mentally or physically ready to execute?
        These alerts give you that edge. For example, you can set a recurring alert “1 minute before” your main candle
        closes—giving you time to refocus, glance at related charts, or double-check confluence. You can set multiple such
        reminders (e.g., 5-min and 1-min) to match your personal routine. These alerts repeat every candle and help keep
        your execution sharp and timely.</p>
      </div>
 

    <div class="faq-item">
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> What are layered alerts, and how are layered notifications different from custom alerts?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Market structure often shifts well before your main timeframe candle closes—making it easy to
        miss emerging setups or misread early signals. Layered alerts solve this by triggering at actual sub-timeframe bar
        closes—like every 5 or 15 minutes within a 1-hour candle. Instead of constantly flipping between charts and
        second-guessing unfinished candles, you get precise, bar-close confirmations across multiple timeframes. For
        example, if your main timeframe is 1 hour, layering 15-minute bars gives you actionable microstructure insight every
        quarter hour. delivered with precision, without distraction, and always on time</p>
      </div>

 

  <div class="faq-item">
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I layer more than one sub-timeframe?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely. For example, you can layer 5-minute, 15-minute, and 30-minute sub-timeframes into
      your 60-minute (1-hour) main interval. This allows you to receive multiple bar-close alerts within each
      hour—offering a more detailed view of market structure across different time horizons.</p>
    </div>
  
   
  
  
  
 
  
  <div class="faq-item">
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> If I layer multiple sub-timeframes, what happens when several timeframes close at the same
      time?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> When multiple sub-timeframe bars close simultaneously, CandleCue will send only the alert for
      the largest (i.e., highest) timeframe at that moment. For example, if your main timeframe is 1 hour and you’ve
      layered both 15-minute and 30-minute intervals, you’ll receive the 30-minute alert at the half-hour marks (e.g.,
      9:30, 10:30), rather than the 15-minute one.<br><br>
      This helps avoid redundant signals and keeps the focus on higher timeframe closes, which often carry more weight in
      trade planning. It also reflects how many traders prioritize higher timeframes for trend context, while using lower
      ones for execution.</p>
    </div>
  
   
  

  <div class="faq-item">
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> I'm a swing trader using the 4-hour timeframe. Can I customize when each 4-hour candle starts?
    </p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. By default, CandleCue uses a 4-hour cycle starting from UTC 0—a common baseline for crypto
      traders. You can set a custom start time in Settings (e.g., 9:00 AM or 9:30 AM local time) in 30-minute increments
      to match your preferred trading hours or market session.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="faq-item">
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I use CandleCue in the background?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. Once activated, both the timer and alerts continue to function even when the app is in the background or your
      phone is asleep. In fact, this is one of CandleCue’s core features—helping you stay synced to market rhythms even when away
      from your screen.  Occasionally, CandleCue may prompt you to the main page to continue receiving notifications, but the timer itself runs continouosly in the backgound at all times.</p>
  </div>
  
 
  <div class="faq-item">
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> When will I be prompted to return to the main page?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Apple enforces a maximum of 64 scheduled notifications limit per app at any
      one time.  Depending on your selected timeframe and any layered alerts, you may reach this limit after a certain number of candles.
     For example, if you're using a 4-hour main timeframe with 1-hour layered alerts, you'll be prompted approximately 60 hours after the timer starts.  When this happens, CandleCue will play a distinct sound and prompt you to return to the main page. By simply tapping on the prompt or reopening the app, the next batch of notifications will be scheduled instantly, and alerts
      will continue. 
      The timer itself continues running in the background the entire time, and no data or alert preferences are lost.</p>
    </div>

 
  <div class="faq-item">
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Does CandleCue require an internet connection?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> No. CandleCue runs entirely offline using your device’s internal system clock. You only need
      internet access to download the app, receive updates, or access support links like the Privacy Policy or Terms of
      Service.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="faq-item">
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Does CandleCue track my data?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> No. CandleCue does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. Your
      use is completely private. The app only saves your selected preferences—such as alert settings or language
      choice—locally on your device to save you time and keep your experience streamlined.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> I don't see any ads in the app. Will CandleCue ever introduce ads?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> No. CandleCue is designed to support focused, distraction-free trade execution and will never
      include ads—whether the timer is running or not. Our goal is to help you stay focused, not distracted.</p>
