    <h1>FAQ</h1>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What is CandleCue used for?</summary>
      <p>CandleCue helps traders stay disciplined by providing structured alerts to candle-close times on their selected
        timeframe—currently supporting 1m, 2m, 3m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, and 4h. Pre-close signals and layered cues from
        shorter
        sub-timeframes provide added awareness within each candle. By setting precise, structured alerts, CandleCue is
        designed to reduce impulsive trades and help you stay aligned with your strategy—candle by candle.</p>
    </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Don’t most trading platforms already show countdowns to candle close?</summary>
        <p>They do—but countdowns on most platforms are small, easy to miss, and tied to a single chart. To keep pace, you
          must constantly watch the screen and keep one symbol open at all times, which can lead to distraction or even
          premature trades based on incomplete candles.</p>
      
        <p>This constant monitoring splits your focus and increases the risk of overtrading—reacting impulsively or drifting
          away from your intended timeframe. Even if you’re disciplined, tracking both chart movement and a tiny off-center
          timer adds unnecessary cognitive strain.</p>
      
        <p>CandleCue reduces that strain by providing hands-free alerts via audio and haptics, timed precisely to your
          candle’s close. Custom pre-close signals and layered sub-timeframe cues help you stay focused on execution—ideal for
          both active traders who want to stay sharp without staring at the countdown and swing traders who only want to tune
          in when it counts.</p>
      </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What are custom alerts, and why do they matter?</summary>
      <p>Ever missed an entry or exit because the candle closed before you were ready? CandleCue’s custom pre-close
        alerts give you a head start by reminding you to refocus and prepare before the candle ends—so you’re ready to
        act when it counts.</p>
      <p>Whether you’re waiting for one last confirmation or second-guessing your setup, these cues bring your focus
        back at
        just the right moment. For example, you can set recurring reminders like “2 minutes before” to finalize your
        checklist, confirm confluence, or get into execution mode. You can even set multiple early alerts (e.g., 5
        minutes
        and 1 minute before) to match your personality or trading routine.</p>
      <p>These alerts repeat every candle, helping you stay sharp, consistent, and ready when it matters.</p>
    </details>

 

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>What are layered alerts, and how do they differ from custom alerts?</summary>
  <p>Market structure often shifts well before a main candle closes—meaning two candles on the same timeframe can look
    identical at the end but tell very different stories underneath. Layered alerts help reveal that story early by
    triggering at the close of sub-timeframe bars—like every 15 minutes within a 1-hour candle—so you can stay in
    rhythm with evolving market conditions.</p>

  <p>This gives you confirmation-based timing cues without needing to constantly flip through different timeframes or
    guess based on an unfinished candle. For example, if your main candle is 1 hour and you set 15-minute sub-timeframe
    layering, you'll get alerts every quarter
    hour when each 15-minute bar closes. This can help you recognize momentum shifts, indecision, or strength as it
    unfolds—<em>before</em> your main candle finishes printing.</p>

  <p>Unlike custom alerts—which notify you shortly before your main candle closes—layered alerts provide completed
    signals from within the candle itself. Used together, they offer a structured, multi-timeframe view of market
    behavior. Layered alerts show what’s developing underneath, while custom alerts help you prepare to act when your
    main candle is about to close—clear, precise, and distraction-free.</p>
</details>


    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Can I layer more than one sub-timeframe?</summary>
      <p>Absolutely. For example, you can layer 5-minute, 15-minute, and 30-minute sub-timeframes into your 60-minute
        (1-hour) main interval. This allows you to receive multiple bar-close notifications within each hour—offering a
        more
        detailed view of market structure across different time horizons.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>If I layer multiple sub-timeframes, what happens when several timeframes close at the same time?
      </summary>
      <p>When multiple sub-timeframe bars close simultaneously, CandleCue will send only the notification for the
        largest
        (i.e., highest) timeframe at that moment. For example, if your main timeframe is 1 hour and you’ve layered both
        15-minute
        and 30-minute intervals, you’ll receive the 30-minute alert at the half-hour marks (e.g., 9:30, 10:30), rather
        than
        the 15-minute one.</p>
      <p>This helps avoid redundant signals and keeps the focus on higher timeframe closes, which often carry more
        weight in
        trade planning. It also reflects how many traders prioritize higher timeframes for trend context, while using
        lower
        ones for execution.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>I’m a swing trader using the 4-hour timeframe. Can I customize when each 4-hour candle starts?</summary>
      <p>Certainly! By default, CandleCue uses a 4-hour cycle starting from UTC+0—a common baseline for crypto traders.
        To change this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong></li>
        <li>Under <strong>Select 4-Hour Block</strong>, choose <strong>Custom</strong></li>
        <li>Then select your desired <strong>Custom Start Time</strong> (e.g., 9:00 AM or 9:30 AM) in 30-minute
          increments
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This allows you to align your candle timing with your local trading hours or a preferred market session.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Does CandleCue still work when my phone is asleep or I’m away from the app?</summary>
      <p>Yes. Once activated, both the timer and alerts continue to function even when the app is running in the
        background—including when your phone is asleep. In fact, alerts will still come through on schedule—even if
        you’ve
        accidentally swiped CandleCue away from your recent apps list (i.e., force-quit). Tapping an alert or reopening
        the app will take you right where you left off.</p>
      <p>This background support is one of CandleCue’s key features—helping traders stay in tune with market rhythm,
        whether
        actively monitoring charts, stepping away briefly, or trading longer timeframes—without needing to worry about
        whether the app is open or the phone is asleep.</p>
      <p>If the app has been in the background for an extended period of time, CandleCue may send a friendly reminder to
        reopen the app to continue receiving notifications, but the timer itself runs continuously in the background at
        all
        times.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Why does CandleCue sometimes ask me to reopen the app?</summary>
      <p>iOS allows only 64 scheduled notifications per app. If CandleCue goes into the background and stays there for
        an
        extended period, those scheduled alerts may eventually run out—depending on your selected timeframe and alert
        settings. For example, this might happen after ~60 hours with a 4-hour main timeframe and 1-hour layered alerts.
      </p>
      <p>When that happens, CandleCue sends a gentle reminder to reopen the app. Just tap the prompt (or open the app
        manually) to reload alerts instantly. Your timer keeps running the entire time, and none of your settings are
        lost.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>How is the “Current Time” determined, and how can I change it?</summary>
      <p>When you first install CandleCue, the app automatically detects your device’s local time zone and assigns a corresponding UTC offset. This offset is used solely to display the “Current Time” at the bottom of the screen.</p>
      <p>You can change this offset at any time in <strong>Settings</strong> under <em>Select UTC Offset</em> to view the current time in
        another
        region—such as a major financial center or preferred market.</p>
      <p>Available UTC offset options range from UTC−10 to UTC+13, including fractional time zones like UTC+5:30 or UTC+9:30.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>UTC−10:</strong> Honolulu (Hawaiian Islands)</li>
        <li><strong>UTC−8:</strong> Los Angeles (non-DST), Vancouver (non-DST)</li>
        <li><strong>UTC−6:</strong> Chicago (non-DST), Guatemala City, Mexico City</li>
        <li><strong>UTC−5:</strong> New York (non-DST), Toronto (non-DST), Cancún, Lima, Bogotá</li>
        <li><strong>UTC−3:</strong> São Paulo, Buenos Aires</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+0:</strong> London (non-DST), Accra, Lisbon (non-DST)</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+1:</strong> Berlin, Paris, Rome, Madrid</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+2:</strong> Athens, Cairo, Johannesburg</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+3:</strong> Moscow, Riyadh, Istanbul, Nairobi</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+4:</strong> Dubai, Baku</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+5:30:</strong> Delhi, Mumbai, Colombo</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+7:</strong> Hanoi, Bangkok, Jakarta</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+8:</strong> Perth, Singapore, Beijing, Kuala Lumpur</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+9:</strong> Tokyo, Seoul</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+9:30:</strong> Adelaide (non-DST), Darwin</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+10:</strong> Brisbane, Sydney (non-DST), Port Moresby</li>
        <li><strong>UTC+13:</strong> Nukuʻalofa (Tonga), Kiritimati (Kiribati)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The UTC offset remains fixed until you change it manually. It does not adjust
        automatically
        for daylight saving time. This setting only affects how the current time is <em>displayed</em>—it does not change how
        alerts
        or timer intervals are calculated.</p>
