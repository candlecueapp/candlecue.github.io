        <summary>What is CandleCue used for?</summary>
        <div class = ="faq-arrow"> 
  <p>CandleCue helps traders stay disciplined by providing structured alerts to candle-close times on their selected
    timeframe—currently
    supporting 1m, 2m, 3m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, and 4h. Pre-close signals and layered cues from shorter
    sub-timeframes provide added awareness within each candle. By setting precise, structured alerts, CandleCue is
    designed to reduce impulsive
    trades and help you stay aligned with your strategy—candle by candle.</p>
  </div>
  </details>



<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>
    <span class="faq-arrow"></span>
    <span class="faq-question"> Don’t most trading platforms already show countdowns to candle close?</span>
  </summary>
  <p>
    Most platforms do show countdowns—but they’re often small, tucked away, and easy to miss. Watching them requires
    constant visual and mental focus, and they’re usually tied to a specific chart—meaning you must keep that symbol
    open at all
    times to stay synced.
  </p>
  <p>
    This setup can lead to premature trades—reacting impulsively to an incomplete bar—or worse, to overtrading, where you
    get so caught up in the moment that you forget your routine and lose track of your timeframe altogether. And even if
    you’re trying to stay disciplined, tracking both chart movement and a tiny, off-center timer still splits your
    attention and wears you down over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      CandleCue helps eliminate these distractions by delivering hands-free alerts through audio and haptic feedback at
      pre-determined schedules—so you’re ready at your candle’s close, when decisions matter most. Custom pre-close signals
      and layered sub-timeframe cues further reduce cognitive load and help you focus on execution—instead of manually
      keeping track of every close.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Ideal for active traders who want to stay sharp without having to constantly stare at the countdown—and swing
          traders who only want to tune in when it counts.</em>
  </p>
</details>



<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>
    <span class="faq-arrow"></span>
    <span class="faq-question"> What are custom alerts, and why do they matter?</span>
  </summary>
  <p>
    Ever missed an entry or exit because the candle closed before you were ready?
    CandleCue’s custom pre-close alerts give you a head start by reminding you to refocus and prepare before the candle
    ends—so you’re ready to act when it counts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you’re waiting for one last confirmation or second-guessing your setup, these cues bring your focus back at
    just the right moment. For example, you can set recurring reminders like “2 minutes before” to finalize your
    checklist, confirm confluence, or get into execution mode.
    You can even set multiple early alerts (e.g., 5 minutes and 1 minute before) to match your personality or trading
    routine.
  </p>
  <p>
    These alerts repeat every candle, helping you stay sharp, consistent, and ready when it matters.
  </p>
</details>



<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>
    <span class="faq-arrow"></span>
    <span class="faq-question">What are layered alerts, and how do they differ from custom alerts?  </span>
  </summary>
  <p>
    Market structure often shifts before a main candle closes—making it easy to miss developing setups or misread early
    signals. That’s why two candles on the same timeframe may look identical but tell completely different stories
    underneath. Layered alerts solve this by triggering at the close of sub-timeframe bars—like every 5 or 15 minutes
    within a 1-hour candle.
  </p>
  <p>
    This means you don’t have to constantly flip timeframes or react prematurely to unfinished candles. Instead, you get
    <em> confirmation-based timing cues </em> across multiple layers—giving you the opportunity to make informed decisions when it
    matters. For example, with a 1-hour main candle and 15-minute layering, you’ll receive alerts every quarter hour
    when the 15-minute bar closes—helping you stay on pace with the market’s rhythm and gain deeper insight into how
    your candle is truly forming.
  </p>
  <p>
    After all, not all candles are created equal: four strong 15-minute closes in a 1-hour bar tell a very different
    story than two bullish pushes followed by two indecision candles. Layered alerts reveal that evolving picture at the
    precise moments those sub-candles close—so you can decide whether to act at the close of your main candle or stay on
    the sidelines.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike custom alerts—which notify you shortly before your main candle closes—layered alerts deliver completed
    sub-timeframe signals. Used together, they offer a structured, multi-timeframe view of market behavior—clear,
    precise, and distraction-free.
  </p>
</details>


<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>
    <span class="faq-arrow"></span>
    <span class="faq-question">Can I layer more than one sub-timeframe? </span>
  </summary>
 
  <p>Absolutely. For example, you can layer 5-minute, 15-minute, and 30-minute sub-timeframes into your 60-minute
    (1-hour) main interval. This allows you to receive multiple bar-close notifications within each hour—offering a more
    detailed view of market structure across different time horizons.</p>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>
    <span class="faq-arrow"></span>
    <span class="faq-question">If I layer multiple sub-timeframes, what happens when several timeframes close at the same time? </span>
  </summary>

  <p>When multiple sub-timeframe bars close simultaneously, CandleCue will send only the notification for the largest
    (i.e.,
    highest) timeframe at that moment. For example, if your main timeframe is 1 hour and you’ve layered both 15-minute
    and 30-minute intervals, you’ll receive the 30-minute alert at the half-hour marks (e.g., 9:30, 10:30), rather than
    the 15-minute one.</p>
  <p>This helps avoid redundant signals and keeps the focus on higher timeframe closes, which
    often carry more weight in trade planning. It also reflects how many traders prioritize higher timeframes for trend
    context, while using lower ones for execution.</p>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>
    <span class="faq-arrow"></span>
    <span class="faq-question"> I'm a swing trader using the 4-hour timeframe. Can I customize when each 4-hour candle starts? </span>
  </summary>
  <p>
    Certainly! By default, CandleCue uses a 4-hour cycle starting from UTC+0—a common baseline for crypto traders.
    To change this:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong></li>
    <li>Under <strong>Select 4-Hour Block</strong>, choose <strong>Custom</strong></li>
    <li>Then select your desired <strong>Custom Start Time</strong> (e.g., 9:00 AM or 9:30 AM) in 30-minute increments
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This allows you to align your candle timing with your local trading hours or a preferred market session.
  </p>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>
    <span class="faq-arrow"></span>
    <span class="faq-question"> Does CandleCue still work when my phone is asleep or I’m away from the app? </span>
  </summary>
  <p>
    Yes. Once activated, both the timer and alerts continue to function even when the app is running in the
    background—including when your phone is asleep. In fact, alerts will still come through on schedule—even if you’ve accidentally swiped CandleCue away from your recent
    apps list (i.e., force-quit). Tapping an alert or reopening
    the
    app will take you right where you left off.
  </p>
  <p>
    This background support is one of CandleCue’s key features—helping traders stay in tune with market rhythm, whether
    actively monitoring charts, stepping away briefly, or trading longer timeframes—without needing to worry about
    whether the app is open or the phone is asleep.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the app has been in the background for an extended period of time, CandleCue may send a friendly reminder to reopen the app to
    continue receiving notifications, but the timer itself runs continuously in the background at all times.
  </p>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>
    <span class="faq-arrow"></span>
    <span class="faq-question"> Why does CandleCue sometimes ask me to reopen the app? </span>
  </summary>
 
  <p>
    iOS allows only 64 scheduled notifications per app. If CandleCue goes into the background and stays there for an
    extended
    period, those scheduled alerts may eventually run out—depending on your selected timeframe and alert settings. For
    example, this might happen after ~60 hours with a 4-hour main timeframe and 1-hour layered alerts.
  </p>
  <p>
    When that happens, CandleCue sends a gentle reminder to reopen the app. Just tap the
    prompt (or open the app manually) to reload alerts instantly. Your timer keeps running the entire time, and none of
    your settings are lost.
    </p>

</details>

  <details class="faq-item">
  <summary>
    <span class="faq-arrow"></span>
    <span class="faq-question"> How is the “Current Time” determined, and how can I change it? </span>
  </summary>
  <p>
    When you first install CandleCue, the app automatically detects your device’s local time zone and sets the UTC
    offset accordingly. This offset is used to display the “Current Time” at the bottom of the screen.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can change this offset at any time in Settings under “Select UTC Offset” to view the current time in another
    region—such as a major financial center or preferred market.
  </p>
  <p>
    UTC offset options range from UTC−10 to UTC+13, including fractional time zones like UTC+5:30 or UTC+9:30.  
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>UTC−10:</strong> Honolulu (Hawaiian Islands)</li>
    <li><strong>UTC−8:</strong> Los Angeles (non-DST), Vancouver (non-DST)</li>
    <li><strong>UTC−6:</strong> Chicago (non-DST), Guatemala City, Mexico City</li>
    <li><strong>UTC−5:</strong> New York (non-DST), Toronto (non-DST), Cancún, Lima, Bogotá</li>
    <li><strong>UTC+0:</strong> London (non-DST), Accra, Lisbon (non-DST)</li>
    <li><strong>UTC+1:</strong> Berlin, Paris, Rome, Madrid</li>
    <li><strong>UTC+2:</strong> Athens, Cairo, Johannesburg</li>
    <li><strong>UTC+3:</strong> Moscow, Riyadh, Istanbul, Nairobi</li>
    <li><strong>UTC+4:</strong> Dubai, Baku</li>
    <li><strong>UTC+5:30:</strong> Delhi, Mumbai, Colombo</li>
    <li><strong>UTC+7:</strong> Hanoi, Bangkok, Jakarta</li>
    <li><strong>UTC+8:</strong> Perth, Singapore, Beijing, Kuala Lumpur</li>
    <li><strong>UTC+9:</strong> Tokyo, Seoul</li>
    <li><strong>UTC+9:30:</strong> Adelaide (non-DST), Darwin</li>
    <li><strong>UTC+10:</strong> Brisbane, Sydney (non-DST), Port Moresby</li>
    <li><strong>UTC+13:</strong> Nukuʻalofa (Tonga), Kiritimati (Kiribati)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The UTC offset remains fixed until you change it manually. It does not adjust automatically
    for daylight saving time. This setting only affects how the current time is displayed—it does not change how alerts
    or timer intervals are calculated.</p>
