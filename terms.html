 <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<!--<p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of CandleCue. By using the app, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not use the service. We recommend reviewing these terms regularly as they may be updated periodically.</p>-->
			 
			 <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of CandleCue. By using the app, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not use the service. These Terms are between you and CEIT Analytics Consulting, LLC (referred to as “we”, “us”, or “our”). We recommend reviewing these Terms regularly as they may be updated periodically.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>1. Intended Use</h2>
      <p>CandleCue is a notification-based service designed to help traders build discipline and confidence in their trading. 
        <!-- alert users of candle-close timing on selected intervals. -->
         <!-- It also supports layered sub-timeframe alerts and custom notifications.  -->
         It does not provide trading advice or signals.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>2. Disclaimer</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This service is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind.</li>
        <li>CandleCue does not guarantee trading performance or outcomes.</li>
        <li>Use of our service is at your own risk and discretion.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

<!--
     <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>3. System Limitations</h2>
      <p>Due to iOS constraints, the app can schedule up to 64 alerts at a time. To continue receiving notifications
        beyond
        that, you must reopen the app to refresh the alert queue.</p>
    </div> 
-->
	<div class="faq-item">
  <h2>3. System Limitations</h2>
  <p>Due to iOS system constraints, CandleCue can schedule a maximum of 64 local notifications at a time. To continue receiving alerts beyond that, users must reopen the app or restart the timer to refresh the alert queue.</p>
  <p>Additionally, certain system-level features—such as Apple Intelligence, Focus Modes, or Low Power Mode—may interfere with the timely delivery of notifications. In rare instances, alerts may be delayed by several seconds. These delays are outside CandleCue’s control and result from iOS prioritization behavior. CandleCue disclaims liability for any timing discrepancies caused by the operating system.</p>
</div>

     <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>4. Privacy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No personal data is collected, stored, or transmitted by CandleCue.</li>
        <li>All alerts and settings are stored locally on your device.</li>
      </ul>
	     <p>For more details, please review our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>You agree not to misuse, decompile, reverse-engineer, modify, or redistribute CandleCue or any of its
        components
        without prior written permission. Unauthorized use may result in termination of access and possible legal
        action.</p>
    </div>
			 
 <div class="faq-item">
  <h2>6. Free Trial</h2>
 <p>If you start a free trial, you will automatically be charged at the end of the trial period unless you cancel at least 24 hours before it ends. <strong>Only one free trial is permitted per Apple ID by Apple’s policy.</strong> This means you cannot use a trial for both the monthly and yearly plans.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <h2>7. Payment and Billing</h2>
  <p>Subscriptions are billed through your Apple ID account upon confirmation of purchase. <strong>Payment will be charged to your Apple ID at the time of purchase</strong> and at the start of each renewal period.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <h2>8. Auto-Renewals</h2>
  <p>Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. <strong>Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <h2>9. Managing Your Subscription</h2>
  <p>You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time by going to your device: <strong>Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; Subscriptions</strong>. <strong>Deleting the app does not cancel your subscription.</strong></p>
</div>

			 <div class="faq-item">
  <h2>10. Switching Subscription Plans</h2>
  <p>You can switch between monthly and yearly CandleCue plans at any time through your Apple ID subscription settings. If you upgrade (e.g., from monthly to yearly), the change takes effect immediately, and Apple may apply a pro-rated credit for the unused time remaining in your current billing period. If you downgrade (e.g., from yearly to monthly), the change takes effect at the end of your current billing period. CandleCue does not manage billing or refunds; all transitions are handled directly by Apple.</p>
</div>

			 			 <div class="faq-item">
  <h2>11.Payments and Refunds </h2>
  <p>All payments and subscriptions are processed by Apple. Refunds are handled directly by Apple. You can request a refund through reportaproblem.apple.com.</p>
</div>


			   <div class="faq-item">
  <h2>12. Internet Connectivity and Subscription Verification</h2>
<p>
CandleCue requires periodic internet access to verify your active subscription status. While the app may continue to function without an internet connection for up to three (3) days, a valid internet connection is required thereafter to maintain access.
</p>
<p>
If the app cannot verify your subscription status after this grace period, access to core features may be temporarily suspended until an internet connection is restored.
</p>
<p>
By using CandleCue, you acknowledge that the app is not designed for indefinite offline use and that continued access to all features depends on periodic subscription verification via the Internet.
</p>
